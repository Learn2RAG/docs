# User documentation
![Main screen](main.png)

The main Learn2RAG interface provides an input field in the middle of the window.
Type your question in the field and then either press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or a graphical button to submit it.
A chat would be opened where the system would provide an answer (possibly with some processing time).
